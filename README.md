# Unity2DGames
My first game development will feature a 2D game called "Wall Breaker". The Player will control the paddle to strike the bouncing ball. Game will end when there is no remaining health available (default is having 3 health), and once the ball has successfully destroyed all walls will the player be able to proceed to the next level.
